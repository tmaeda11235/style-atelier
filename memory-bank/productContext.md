# Product Context

## Vision
**"Turn your Prompts into Assets."**
Elevate Midjourney prompt management from a simple text notepad to a TCG-like asset management system and an intuitive "atelier" for mixing styles.

## The Problem
- **Prompt Chaos**: Managing complex prompts as text strings is difficult and uninspiring.
- **Reproducibility**: "How did I make that?" is a common question. Recovering exact styles is hard.
- **Asset Value**: Created styles are valuable but difficult to package, share, or brand.

## The Solution
Midjourney Style Manager is a "Local-First" Chrome Extension that treats prompts as "Style Cards."
- **Minting**: Convert generated images into trading cards with encapsulated prompt data.
- **Organization**: Manage collections with binders, decks, and tiers.
- **Production**: A visual workspace to mix and match cards to generate new prompts.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Midjourney Power Users (Image Creators).
- **Needs**: Reproducibility, asset management, branding, and efficient workflow.

## User Experience Goals
1.  **Visual & Tangible**: Move away from text lists to visual cards and binders.
2.  **Gamified Ownership**: Satisfy the desire to collect and organize with rarity tiers and frames.
3.  **Fluid Workflow**: "Atelier" interface for intuitive prompt mixing (drag & drop).
4.  **Privacy First**: All data stays local; no external servers holding your creative secrets.
